Hello, I’m @UZGPROGER! 👋

👀 I’m interested in creating engaging web applications and developing games that can offer something new and unique to users.
🌱 I’m currently learning React for frontend development and Unity for game development to expand my skills and capabilities.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with talented designers and experienced developers to create exciting projects together.
📫 You can reach me through Telegram or email, which are listed on my YouTube channel.
😄 Pronouns: Uzbekistan>Samarkand
⚡ Fun fact: I started my journey in development through game modding, which led me to create my own gaming YouTube channel where I share my projects and gameplay.
This is just the beginning of my path, and I’m full of enthusiasm about future projects and opportunities! 💻🎮
